This Streamlit application serves as an innovative platform for fish enthusiasts and researchers, leveraging a combination of machine learning, geolocation, and interactive web technologies. At its core, the application features a pre-trained deep learning model capable of identifying various fish species from uploaded images. Users can navigate through three main sections: the Home page, which showcases a gallery of fish images; the Upload Images page, where users upload fish images for species identification and their geographical location is logged; and the Find Fish page, where users can select a fish species and view its locations on an interactive map. The application seamlessly integrates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve fish sighting data, enhancing user engagement and providing valuable insights into fish distribution patterns.
